# Mercado Libre search app

## Getting started

```
  git clone https://github.com/santigrecco/mlchallenge.git
  cd mlchallenge
  yarn install
  cd public
  yarn install
  cd ..
  yarn start or yarn build-server
```

`yarn start` will start the server and the front app in dev mode.
`yarn build-server` wil build the front app and run the server after (it might have some issues when refreshing, so better use yarn start)

the app will be running on http://localhost:5000

##Info

-  Didn't use typescript on the server side due to lack of time :(
